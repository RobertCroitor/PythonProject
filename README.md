        <h2>1. Project details</h2>
        <p>Se doreste creare unei aplicatii de retete culinare care permite sugerarea de retete pe baza unor ingrediente minimizand numarul de ingrediente suplimentare necesare. Un utilizator va putea adauga retete (ingrediente, pasi de preparare, dificultate, durata preparare, durata finalizare). Vizitatorii pot cauta retete introducand ingredientele pe care le au la dispozitie si o serie de alte criterii suplimentare, cum ar fi: ingrediente suplimentare indezirabile, dificultate, durata preparare, durata finalizare etc.). Lista rezultatelor va putea fi ordonata dupa diverse criterii: popularitate, durata preparare, durata finalizare, dificultate. Utilizatorul poate alege sa marcheze ca a preparat o retata adaugand minim o fotografie cu rezultatul final (in acest fel este determinata popularitate unei retete). Daca utilizatorul care cauta o reteta nu este autentificat, atunci preferintele ultimei cautari vor fi salvate la nivel de browser, altfel in contul utilizatorului respectiv. Se vor oferi clasamente in formatele HTML, CSV si JSON cu cele mai populare retete, cele mai populare ingrediente, ingredientele cele mai evitate.</p>

        <h3>5. Documentation</h3>
        <p>The user can register with an unique name(in the server will be verified if it is unique) he will be redirected to the login page where he will be able to login.We verify in our datat base if that user exists and we will compare his input password with the password that has been decrypted from data base.If they both match we will send a JWT token to the front end.The token will contain if the user is an admin or not.</p>
        <p> For our routing we have used as a documentation the folowing repository <a>https://github.com/stefanT9/Routing-In-NodeJs</a></p>
        <p>For jwt token we used <a>https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken</a></p>
        <p>The search component we have used commas to separate ingredients and then we make a POST type request in the data base(the ingredients and the token will be sent).In the data base we look after the recipies that only contain those ingredients.For typo corection we used Propose <a>https://www.npmjs.com/package/propose</a> wich will compare each ingredient from one existent in the data base.If its close to matching they will corect the word if it doesnt the word will be left as it is.The token will be verified to see if the user is logged in as an admin or logged in at all.The recipies will be sorrted by ingredients count and then we will wrap aditional information(like if the user is logged in, the name of the user, etc).Based on the response from the server the user will have the option to delete a recipe or a recipe image.</p>
        <p>The add favorite component will increase the popularity of a receipe and they will be saved in the field of "Favorites" of user in the Data Base.</p>
        <p>Any logged user cand add an image with their finished receipe.We used formidable to parse the files and interpret them in the server side<a>https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable</a>.An admin can delete an existing photo making a post rewuest to the server sending it the recipe name and the photo name</p>
